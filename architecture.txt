Transliteration Detection and Recovery System for Thai-English
A system that detects and converts transliterated English words in Thai text back to their original English form. Based on the blueprint you've shared and my understanding of how major AI companies likely tackle this problem, let's develop a comprehensive approach.
System Architecture Overview
Here's a step-by-step approach to building an advanced transliteration detection and recovery system:
1. Data Collection and Preprocessing
Datasets to acquire:

NECTEC LEXiTRON dictionary (contains Thai-English transliterations)
Thai Wikipedia with parallel English articles
CCAligned/OPUS corpora with Thai-English pairs
Social media corpora (Twitter, Pantip, Reddit) for real-world transliterations
Create a custom dataset of Thai-English transliterations if possible

Preprocessing steps:

Clean and normalize text (standardize spacing, handle Thai-specific typography)
Segment Thai text into words/tokens (challenging since Thai doesn't use spaces)
Create paired examples of Thai transliterations with English originals

2. Candidate Detection Pipeline
This determines which Thai words are likely transliterated from English:
Thai Text → Tokenization → Candidate Detection → Filtered Candidates
Implementation approaches:

Rule-based heuristics: Identify rare Thai syllables or character patterns often used in transliterations (คอม, เซอร์, ด์)
Statistical classifier: Train a model on n-gram features that distinguish native Thai vs. transliterated words
Transformer classifier: Fine-tune a Thai language model to predict if a token is transliterated
Character-level embeddings: Use embeddings to identify words with unusual character patterns

3. Transliteration Recovery Pipeline
This converts the detected transliterated words back to English:
Transliterated Candidate → Phonetic Mapping → English Candidates → Context Reranking → English Word
Core components:

G2P (Grapheme-to-Phoneme) module: Convert Thai characters to IPA or phonetic representation
Phoneme-to-English mapping: Match phonetic representations to potential English words
Contextual reranking: Use language models to select the most appropriate English word given the context

4. Integration with Neural Translation
To improve accuracy, integrate with translation:
Thai Text → Translation + Alignment → Cross-reference with Candidates → Final Output
Implementation approach:

Use neural machine translation (NMT) model to generate full translation
Apply attention alignment to map Thai words to English equivalents
Cross-reference alignment results with your candidate detection to improve precision

Training and Fine-tuning
For optimal performance, you'll need to train several models:
1. Transliteration Detector Training

Create labeled dataset:

Positive examples: Thai sentences with English transliterations (labeled)
Negative examples: Pure Thai sentences without transliterations


Train with sequence labeling:

Fine-tune WangchanBERTa or XLM-RoBERTa for token classification
Use BIO tagging scheme (B-TRANS, I-TRANS, O)


Evaluation metrics:

Precision, recall, F1-score on token-level classification
Word-level accuracy for complete transliteration identification



2. Thai-to-English Transliterator Training

Parallel data preparation:

Collect pairs of (Thai transliteration, English original)
Example: ("คอมพิวเตอร์", "computer")


Training approaches:

Encoder-decoder with character-level inputs and outputs
Seq2seq with attention mechanisms
Transformer-based models with Bangkok BERT or XLM-R as encoder


Data augmentation techniques:

Generate variants with different Thai spellings for the same English word
Apply minor character substitutions to create more training examples


Performance Optimization
To make your system as advanced as those used by major companies:

Model quantization:

Convert models to int8/fp16 precision for faster inference
Use ONNX Runtime or TensorRT for optimized inference


Caching strategies:

Cache common transliterations to avoid redundant processing
Implement token-level caching for repeated words


Distributed processing:

Deploy using Kubernetes for scaling
Use load balancing for high-volume processing


Monitoring and continuous improvement:

Implement logging for failed transliterations
Create feedback loop to improve the system over time



Evaluation and Benchmarking
To evaluate how your system compares to those of major companies:

Create test sets:

Curated examples of common transliterations
Social media samples with mixed Thai-English usage
Technical content with specialized terms


Metrics to track:

Precision/recall for detection
Character Error Rate (CER) for transliteration accuracy
Processing time per token/request


A/B comparisons:

Compare outputs with Google Translate API
Test against publicly available commercial APIs
